{"name":"Sandbox","tagline":"The ADL Sandbox is a persistent virtual environment that runs in a web browser.","body":"ADL Sandbox\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThe ADL sandbox is an application based on the [Virtual World Framework](https://github.com/virtual-world-framework/vwf)\r\nwith multiplayer simulation and content authoring capabilities. The whole application runs in native Javascript,\r\nso no plugins or installs are required.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Multiplayer simulation space\r\n* No-install client\r\n* Fully scriptable behaviors on in-world objects\r\n* Manipulation and deformation tools similar to Second Life\r\n* Integration with the 3D Repository for asset streaming\r\n* Native in-browser audio/video chat (for capable browsers)\r\n\r\nRequirements (Server)\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n* Node.js v0.8 or newer\r\n* Minimal CPU and memory resources\r\n\r\nRequirements (Client)\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe simulation runs in the native browser, so in order for the app to run correctly your browser\r\nmust have support for the following technologies:\r\n\r\n* WebGL\r\n* ECMAScript5\r\n* WebSockets\r\n* WebRTC (for audio/video calls)\r\n\r\nSandbox has been tested and verified to run on the latest stable Chrome and Firefox, though Firefox\r\nstable does not support video calls (Firefox beta/nightly does). The Sandbox does not run in Internet\r\nExplorer 10 or less due to the lack of WebGL support, though some degree of support will be included\r\nin Internet Explorer 11 (not tested as of this writing).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the system must meet the minimum hardware requirements:\r\n\r\n* Dual-core processor\r\n* 2GB RAM\r\n\r\nMore complex scenes will be more demanding on clients, so these specs may not be sufficient for\r\nsome simulations. Your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nInstallation (Server)\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository from Github (https://github.com/adlnet/Sandbox)\r\n2. Install Node.js (optional)\r\n\r\n\tNote: A Node.js v0.8.3 Windows binary is included with the repository, and it is verified to work.\r\n\tFeel free to use this binary instead of installing all of Node.js.\r\n\r\n3. Create data directory somewhere on the drive (default: C:\\VWFData)\r\n\r\n\tThe directory should have the following structure:\r\n\r\n\t    (datadir)\r\n\t\t> GlobalAssets\r\n\t\t> Logs\r\n\t\t> Profiles\r\n\t\t> States\r\n\t\t> Textures\r\n\t\t> Thumbnails\r\n\r\n4. Run the server: > node app.js -d &lt;datadir> -p &lt;port>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
